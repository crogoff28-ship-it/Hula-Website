        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our purpose is to spread the values of hula around the islands and to
          preserve Hawaiian culture and history through storytelling. We also
          want to help foster a deeply connected relationship with the
          environment and grow their ancestral knowledge. Additionally, we
          believe hula helps promote both physical and mental well-being as it
          helps us calm ourselves through dance. In other words, hula is an
          expression without words that comes from the heart. Rather than a
          traditional dance class, hula is the transfer of wisdom from kumu hula
          (master teacher) to their haumana (students) with an equal form of
          respect and interconnectedness with the ‘āina.

        <h2>Origin & Background</h2>
        <p>
          Hula is as ancient as the Hawaiian people themselves, and many legends
          explain its origin. Some traditions believe Laka, the navigator
          goddess, invented hula; others state Hi’iaka created the dance for her
          sister Pele. Some say Pele herself, the volcano and fire goddess,
          created hula. Although many more theories and myths exist, they all
          reflect the same idea inherent to Hawaiian culture: the art of hula
          holds power. From storytelling, spiritual beliefs, connectedness, and
          knowledge, hula is deeply rooted in the people of Hawaii.
        </p>
        <p>
          Banning hula in 1830 by the Westerners didn't stop the Hawaiians from
          practicing their hula in secret, but still left the Hawaiians silenced
          and feeling powerless. King David Kalākaua restored public hula
          performances in the late 1800s through the Merrie Monarch. For better
          or for worse, the Hawaiian culture was changing, and therefore, new
          hybrid styles of hula emerged. Contact with the Westerners, cultural
          exchange, and changing Hawaiian society all play a role in the
          evolution of Hula.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, hula spread globally, reaching communities worldwide,
          sharing Hawaiian traditions. It is crucial that hula remains authentic
          to its cultural values and embodies truth, wisdom, and celebration.
          Hula continues to evolve, carrying the stories of past generations as
          it honors where it began.

        <h2>Kumu</h2>
        <p>
          Kumu Naomi, a well-respected kumu hula at Hanalei School, spoke to me
          about the humility, grace, and honor required to teach the next
          generation of hula. To be a kumu means remaining open to learning and
          understanding the culture and gravity of what it means to practice
          hula. Hula itself helps foster a deeply interconnected relationship
          with the land and culture. Hula, the Hawaiians' storytelling through
          motion, has trudged onward due to the great kumus before us that have
          helped the poeple everywhere connect with their culture, find a sense
          of identity, and create a relationship with the land and nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being a kumu requires more than a mastery of a skill, but also an
          artistry of leadership and an ablility to guide others toward the
          right paths. Earning the title of kumu is a noble accomplishment.
          Kumus hold the responsibility of passing on and sharing wisdom and
          knowledge of their own teachers while still embodying their own
          presence.
